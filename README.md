# WavePortal


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. 

Included is a smart contract, tests for that contract, a script that deploys the contract, and examples of the actual task implementation ('waving' or to send ether). You will notice a lot of information logged in the console upon the various different state checks, and changes, within the app lifecycle.

The UI was designed in React (Repl.it) and is simply a shell for invoking our smart contract and displaying relevant UI elements to the user. This completes the project which can now be referred to as a decentralized app or a dApp. 

Tech Stack and goodies used:
Javascript, Node/node.js, Solidity, React, Repl.it, Hardhat, Alchemy.

Try some of the following commands to interact with the hardhat instance:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
